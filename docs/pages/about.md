## Backstory

Colette and Eric met on the high plains in the midst of a multi-week cat herding session.

Or, more accurately, they met at work, bonding over the struggles of songwriting, anarchist musings on leadership, and concerns about the premature sentience of the internet. Baseball was involved, and Eric maybe snubbed a little kid at Fenway. But hey, that foul ball landed in his lap fair and square.
