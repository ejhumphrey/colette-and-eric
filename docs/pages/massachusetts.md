### Accommodations

We've put in for a room block in Smithfield RI at the [Hampton Inn & Suites](http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/rhode-island/hampton-inn-and-suites-providence-smithfield-PVDSFHX/index.html). Please reach out to us for the group code! There's a pool and we've been told really nice WiFi. We know, right? You were on the fence, but *now* you're totally sold.


### Getting to Point Breeze

The nearest airports are Worcester's Regional Airport (ORH), Providence's TF Green (PVD), Hartford's Bradley International (BDL), or Boston's Logan (BOS).

**NOTE!** We're trying to secure a bus / shuttle from the Hampton Inn & Suites to Point Breeze. Hopefully, this will be able to cover everyone at the hotel and then some. Stay tuned for more info.

Otherwise, you'll need to have / rent / hire a car to get to Webster.
